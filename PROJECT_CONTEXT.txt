- Support internal catalog management (admin tools and APIs).

CURRENT STATE SUMMARY
- Backend: Django REST API skeleton with a custom User model and a demo file storage service using MinIO.
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind; current UI is a backend/MinIO smoke test.
- Infra: docker-compose with Django (gunicorn), nginx, Postgres, Redis, Celery worker/beat, MinIO.

- Apps:
  - api: Hello endpoint and FileRecord model with presigned upload/download URLs.
  - users: Custom User model with role (admin/manager) and role-based permission helpers.
- Auth: JWT; default permission is IsAuthenticated (hello and file endpoints are AllowAny).
- Storage: MinIO client for presigned PUT/GET; bucket created at startup (minio_setup.py).

GAPS FOR CARBON69 GOALS
- No product, catalog, or category models or endpoints.
- No cart, checkout, orders, or customer account flows.
- Frontend has no company branding, catalog UI, or marketing pages.
- No search, filtering, or inventory management.

NEXT STEP IDEAS
- Define core domain models: Product, Category, Brand, Fitment, Inventory, Price.
- Build catalog APIs (list, search, detail) and admin workflows.
- Design site pages: Home, Catalog, Product Detail, About, Contact, Cart.
- Decide ecommerce scope: guest checkout vs accounts, payments, tax/shipping.
